ADVENTURE1 = """Throne of the Dead
Throne of the Dead is intended for four
characters with an average party level (APL)
of 3. Characters who complete this
adventure should earn enough experience
to reach halfway to 4th-level. A secret ruin
has been discovered beneath the king`s
palace and the adventurers must seek out a
missing wizard who went exploring. This campaign takes
place in Arden, although it can be set in your own world.
This adventure favors clerics and paladins though any
party composition should be able to ȴnish the adventure
with intelligent play.

Background
The royal palace was built on the remains of a keep that
was abandoned many years ago. Recent renovations have
uncovered a secret passage that leads deep beneath the
castle, and the court wizard Dorja went down to
investigate... he hasn`t been seen since. What no one
knows is that the ruins beneath the castle are actually a
temple to a dark god. Inside, undead husks roam that
once worshipped there before they were sealed in long
ago. The high priest of the temple, wishing to elongate his
life, made a pact with a dark god and became a vampire.
Now he waits on his throne for the day when he`ll be freed
from his self-imposed prison.

Adventure Hooks
The King`s Messenger. The characters received a letter
from the king requesting they come at once to his castle.
His court wizard has gone missing in the catacombs
beneath the palace.
Adventurers for Hire. The characters answered a
posting on the bounty board regarding a missing wizard
and were instructed to inquire at the king`s castle.
Into the Unknown The characters heard that ruins
were recently discovered beneath the royal palace. Eager
to explore, they answered the king`s call for adventurers.

The Ruins Down Below
The ruins beneath the palace are fairly ancient. They were
built centuries ago when this place was the center of
worship for a dark god. When that civilization fell, the
temple was partially destroyed and built over. Only
recently has its existence come to light.

General Features
Ceilings. The ceilings are made of ȴnely worked stone
and rise 10 ft. above the ȵoor.
Floors and Walls. The ȵoors and walls are made of
cobbled granite. A thick layer of dust and cobwebs cover
everything.
Doors. The doors are made of thick oak and are held
together by iron bands. They`re all unlocked unless stated
otherwise.

Empty Rooms. There are a handful of small rooms on
the map that lack a number. They can be bathrooms,
storage closets, or whatever you wish.
Lighting. Aside from the light coming in from the door
to the outside, the ruins are pitch black.
Unusual Features. An underground river ȵows
through the center of the complex. It`s 5 ft. deep and
frigid.

1. Entryway
This stone passage leads south to a door and
east to a portcullis. A mural is set into the
stone wall to the west just south of the
northern door.
The portcullis is jammed shut. It can be opened with a DC
18 Strength check. Alternatively, someone can unjam the
mechanism holding it closed with a DC 16 Dexterity
(Sleight of Hand) check.
Trap: Wall Darts. The mural on the wall hides a sinister
trap. If someone steps on the square of stone in front of it,
tiny needles shoot out at whoever is standing there. They
must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw taking 1d10
piercing damage on a failure and half as much on a
success.

2. Foyer
This small room contains two open armoires,
each containing what appear to be
ceremonial cloaks.
Obstacle: Only the Worthy May Pass. The southern
door is locked by magic and will only open for someone
wearing one of the ceremonial cloaks. It cannot be opened
otherwise.

3. Temple
Broken benches sit rotted on the ȵoor. At the
far end of the room, two inhuman statues can
be seen. In the center of the room, ȴgures
wearing tattered robes shuɞe about.
Encounter: The Chosen. The ȴgures are three
skeletons and two ghouls. They were the former
worshippers of the temple who were sealed in when the
entrance collapsed many years ago.

Treasure. Eyes of Night. The eyes of the statues are
made of polished onyx. They can be pried out with a DC 12
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. There are four in total
and they`re each worth 25 gp.

4. Half-Flooded Chamber
Stairs lead down to a partially submerged
chamber. A river currently ȵows through it
and broken pottery and containers can be
seen scattered about at the water`s edge.
Treasure: All that Glitters. There is a +1 longsword at
the bottom of the river. It can be spotted with a DC 13
Wisdom (Perception) check.
Obstacle: So Very Cold. The water is quite frigid.
Anyone who enters it must make a DC 14 Constitution
saving throw or else they take 1d10 cold damage.

5. Collapsed Chamber
This chamber appears to have once ben a
large hall of some kind, however, it has since
collapsed in upon itself. Now, it resembles a
cavern more than a manmade structure.
Encounter: Stone Worms. Two grick can be found living
in this part of the complex. They hide at ȴrst and attack if
anyone tries to move through the center of the chamber.

6. Living Quarters
Numerous broken beds lie scattered across
the ȵoor here. Shuɞing about them are half a
dozen rotted corpses in tattered robes.
Encounter: The Fallen. There are six zombies in this
chamber. They attack as soon as someone enters the
room. They try to grapple and overwhelm anyone who
gets too close.
Treasure: Holy Relics. A container can be found under
one of the damaged beds. It contains an ancient holy
symbol worth 50 gp and clerical vestments worth 75 gp

7. Throne Room
A large stone bridge spans a river 10 ft. below.
On the far side, three statues can be seen
along with an onyx throne. On it, sits a man
with pale skin, white hair, and red eyes.
Encounter: Undeath Becomes Him. The man is a
vampire spawn. He was formerly the high priest of the
temple. When the entrance collapsed, he made a pact with
his dark god to evade his impending death and was
transformed into a vampire. He fed o΍ his worshippers
until they all were dead and has been slumbering ever
since. When Dorja came down to investigate, he
inadvertently woke him up and became his ȴrst meal in
centuries. The vampire spawn is intelligent and ȴghts
accordingly. He fears the running water and will take acid
damage if he ends his turn in it. The characters might be
able to use this to their advantage. If he feels he is losing
the ȴght, he`ll use the secret door behind the throne to try
and ȵee.
Secret Door: Escape Passage. There is a secret door
hidden behind the throne. It can be spotted with a DC 16
Wisdom (Perception) check and opened with a DC 14
Intelligence (Investigation) check. It leads to the top of area
8.

8. Secret Passage
The secret passage leads from the water up to a small
chamber behind the throne room. Resting against the wall
near the secret door is the blood-drained corpse of Dorja
the wizard. Encounter: Dark as Night. There is a
darkmantle on the ceiling above the large stone in the
center of the chamber. It attacks the ȴrst creature to move
under it (including the vampire spawn). Treasure: A
Wizard`s Belongings. The wizard Dorja has a potion of
healing, a +1 quartersta΍, and his spellbook on him. It
contains the following spells.
Cantrips: ȴre bolt, light, mage hand, prestidigitation
1st-Level: detect magic, mage armor, magic missile,
shield

Aftermath
With the vampire spawn dead, the threat beneath the
palace has been neutralized. The king awards each party
member 50 gp and allows them to keep whatever they
found down below. Although the undead have been dealt
with, there`s always the possibility that something else
moves into the space in the future from deeper below.
